</ul>

<ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>For sauce: Combine all the sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bow; set aside for flavors to develope while making crust. Freeze remaining paste.</li>
    <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
    <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour , if needed. </li>
    <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12 inch greased pizza pan <strong>or</strong> roll dough to fit pans.</li>
    <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway though baking.</li>
